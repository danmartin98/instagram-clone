# Instagram Clone

## I have been working on building an Instagram clone with React and JavaScript!  

By the end of the project, I will have used:
* React (custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef)
* Firebase (Firestore/auth)
* Tailwind CSS
* LoadTest
* Lighthouse
* Vercel
* React Testing Library
* Cypress E2E Testing.

**Full disclosure** This is not a project I have made from scratch, I’m simply following a tutorial from the excellent Karl Hadwen to help cement my coding skills as well as learn about new technologies and methods. This course is a work in progress and I have already learned a huge amount, and feel much more confident in concepts I already knew. 

## This React project will have multiple pages
* login
* sign up
* dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos)
* user profiles. 
* The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, Firebase auth is used to store the user in the Firebase auth database.

After the application is built I will learn how to deploy it to Vercel.

This project has posed several challenges so far, because I have had to spend a lot of time refactoring the dependencies to a newer syntax, predominantly React router and Tailwind so far have required the most refactoring. Although it’s frustrating at times, it’s great industry experience.
